			<h3>Introduction</h3>
			<!-- Add image below this comment -->
			<p><span style="font-size: 20px;">Syracuse and the greater Central New York region has always been seen as a politically diverse setting. With a strong blue-collar presence in the suburbs, an impoverished city, and a major R1 University embellishing the community, there are an array of different political viewpoints. However, in a country where the majority rule decides who represents you in congress and creates legislation on the behalf of their constituents (barring the Presidency) there seems to be a missing link in Onondaga County. While there seems to be such a strong, expected democratic presence amongst voters in the NY-22 congressional district, why has a Republican won the federal House of Representatives seat nine out of the past ten years? And why does it spill out into local elections?</p>

			<h3>NY-22 Constituents, by the Numbers</h3>
			<div class="image-container">

			<p><span style="font-size: 20px;"> According to the <a href="https://elections.ny.gov/enrollment-congressional-district">data compiled from the annual release of voter registration statistics by the New York State Board of Elections </a>, polls in New York’s 22nd would be promising for a more liberal policy agenda, however the results tell a different story. Taking a look at visualization one (right), Republicans have held the NY-22 (sometimes NY-24 due to election lines changing) House seat since Former Representative John Katko took office in 2015. <a href="https://www.ny.gov/new-york-state-congressional-delegation"> Ny.gov </a> shows that Katko would then pass the torch to Finger Lakes native and long-term Upstate New York Conservative Claudia Tenney, who after getting drawn out of the district, would hand the reins to Brandon Williams, a Dallas native who had bought a farm in Sennett around 16 years ago. According to the findings, Democrats made up an average of 52.52% (165,645 voters) of the electorate, whilst Republicans totaled roughly 47.46% (149,408 voters) of registered voters in the Congressional District. Onondaga County accounts for the democratic majority, where in 2023, nearly 60% of voters in the County were registered as a Democrat. The outlying counties such Madison, Oneida and Oswego that have smaller regions included in NY-22 account for the Republican balance. Onondaga County Election Commissioner Dustin Czarny introduces in his <a href="https://dustinczarny.com/2024/05/05/the-weekly-wonk-new-yorks-22nd-congressional-district-2024/">Weekly Wonk: New York’s 22nd Congressional District 2024 </a> that incumbency was the word of the region, stating, “The power of incumbency helped him (Katko) overcome the demographics of Central New York, especially Onondaga County, had its effect on the district making it increasingly blue. The Special Master map of the last cycle stemmed that advance by adding more GOP into the district and stagnating the Democratic gains which resulted in a narrow victory for Brandon Williams.” But Czarny believes that these recently approved legislative lines could make NY-22 an emerging blue political wave, but only if the Democratic Party can increase voter turnout. </p>

				<p><span style="font-size: 20px;">Voter fatigue has been a topic of controversy in Central New York, for a multitude of reasons. Looking at this year alone, a Presidential rematch between what many are calling “the lesser of two evils” has voters unenthusiastic about what next in American Politics, <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2024/03/04/trump-biden-unhappy-voters-presidential-election-democrat-republican/72788422007/">according to USA Today</a>. Right here in the county, a <a href="https://cnycentral.com/news/local/onondaga-county-republicans-approve-funding-intend-to-sue-nys-over-election-year-changes">Republican effort from the County Legislature </a> sees <a href="https://youtu.be/4J9il76vyJY?si=awNoBoVl3Xf_28tG"> $100,000 taxpayer dollars being used to sue New York State </a> after Governor Kathy Hochul signed into law that local and federal elections would merge in even years in hopes of combating voter inactivity. This concept is what many think haunts the Democratic Party of the region. According to the visualization above, Voter Inactivity amidst registered Democrats has sat roughly between 1.5% to 2% over the last decade, which could account for the narrow Republican victories of the recent past. <a href="https://www.electmauricebrown.com/">Maurice Brown</a>, the Democratic County Legislator who represents students of SU on south campus and off-campus housing, says the party’s failure is due to organizational issues, “Locally our party has been out of touch with the community and has done a poor job of recruiting and running candidates that accurately represent the area. When voters feel unrepresented, there is less of a desire to vote.” But no matter the cause of what’s causing voters to evade the polls, the lack of attendance between the parties along with the decision from independents could decide a number of elections come November, including the Presidency and House Seat in NY-22, according to the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/25/magazine/2024-election-nonvoters.html"> New York Times.</a>

			<h3>What's Next?</h3>
			<p><span style="font-size: 20px;">Circling back to <a href="https://dustinczarny.com/2024/05/05/the-weekly-wonk-new-yorks-22nd-congressional-district-2024/"> Czarny’s piece </a> on Hochul’s newly approved federal NY congressional maps, the independent redistricting commission may have done the work for Democratic Hopefuls. In his report, the election Commissioner highlights a new statistic that would be introduced with these new maps. Registered Democrats in the district would rise to around 174,000 (just over 54%) while Republican digits would dip to above 144,000 voters. This is the highest difference seen in the region since the spike of two years ago (which ended up not having an effect on the election, likely due to that year lacking a Presidential Race). Czarny further emphasizes how this election could mean trouble for Representative Brandon Williams, but acknowledges that the Democrats first need to decide upon their sole candidate before the race can truly begin.</p>
